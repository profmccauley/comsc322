# PA3 - A Shell of Your Own

In this assignment, you are writing your own shell.

See the assignment document for details.

There are some tests similar to ones I'll use when grading included.  These
are not comprehensive, but hopefully they'll give you an idea of how you're
doing.  You can run them in two ways:

* make tests - This will run all the tests.  Some are kind of slow.
* make fast-tests - This will only run the fast tests.

Of course, a normal "make" will just compile the program.
